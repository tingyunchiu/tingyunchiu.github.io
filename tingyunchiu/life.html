            <h5>Once upon a time, there is a little girl, let's name her Ting-Yun. She was born and raised in Taiwan. So, like your stereotypical Asian girl. She was shy and quiet, had excellent grades, and of course, she held an engineering degree ;)<br>
            However, she wasn't really happy with her college life. She wasn't passionate about chips or machines. Along with some hostilities for being a woman in engineering, she started to explore other areas of interest and opportunities during her college.</h5>

            <h5>After graduation from her university, she went to New York, enrolling in a master's program to study women in STEM. Her first year of grad school was tough. She had contacted more than 100 professors or Ph.D. students but unable to a sponsor for her thesis. <br>
            Luckily, she went out for lunch with a friend through whom she found her thesis supervisor and then her sponsor. She landed in the lab that studied political ideology and its impacts, and she discovered her interest in data and coding.</h5>

            <h5>Another challenge came after graduating from her master's program, she couldn't find a research-oriented job in NPO or NGO in the States. At this moment, she realized that even these organizations accepted foreign software engineers. And thus, she started to expand her interests from data science to web development. Hoping that one day, she will be able to inspire and empower people with her programming skills.</h5>

            <h5>As most of the kids grew up in Asia, exercising and hobbies had never come into her mind, let alone the idea of work-life balance. When Ting-Yun was in grad school, heavy schoolwork and the anxiety of living in a foreign country made her physical and mental health worse. At this moment, she realized that she needed to start developing some hobbies and workout regularly.<br>
            One day, she was traveling in the Rocky mountain in Colorado. She saw people climbing on the rocks. "That's it! I am going to do it someday", she said to herself. So, she started to climb at the end of 2019. Feb 2021, she had her first outdoor climbing experience <span>&#9786;</span> In addition to rock climbing, she also enjoys hiking.</h5>
